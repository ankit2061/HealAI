## 🚀 Overview

**Heal AI** helps patients and healthcare providers handle medical insurance claims with ease. It extracts key information from medical documents, explains confusing terms, checks for completeness, and guides users through the entire claims process — all through a conversational AI interface.

### 🔥 Why Heal AI?
Filing insurance claims is often overwhelming due to:
- Messy, unstructured medical documents
- Confusing insurance jargon
- Frequent errors and rejections
- Lack of real-time help or feedback

**Heal AI solves all of these.**
